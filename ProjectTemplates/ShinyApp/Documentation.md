## Community Toolkit MVVM

The CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package (aka MVVM Toolkit, formerly named Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm) is a modern, fast, and modular MVVM library. It is part of the .NET Community Toolkit and is built around the following principles:

Platform and Runtime Independent - .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET 6 ðŸš€ (UI Framework Agnostic)
Simple to pick-up and use - No strict requirements on Application structure or coding-paradigms (outside of 'MVVM'ness), i.e., flexible usage.
Ã€ la carte - Freedom to choose which components to use.
Reference Implementation - Lean and performant, providing implementations for interfaces that are included in the Base Class Library, but lack concrete types to use them directly.

<!--#if (syslinqasync)-->
## System.Linq.Async

IAsyncEnumerable<T>, and the associated version C# (8.0) added intrinsic support for this interface with its await foreach construct.

Although .NET Core 3.0 defined IAsyncEnumerable<T>, it did not add any corresponding LINQ implementation. Whereas IEnumerable<T> supports all the standard operators such as Where, GroupBy, and SelectMany, .NET does not have built-in implementations of any of these for IAsyncEnumerable<T>. However, Ix had provided LINQ operators for its prototype version of IAsyncEnumerable<T> from the start, so when .NET Core 3.0 shipped, it was a relatively straightforward task to update all those existing LINQ operators to work with the new, official IAsyncEnumerable<T>.

Thus, the System.Linq.Async NuGet package was created, providing a LINQ to Objects implementation for IAsyncEnumerable<T> to match the one already built into .NET for IEnumerable<T>.

Since all of the relevant code was already part of the Ix project (with IAsyncEnumerable<T> also originally having been defined by this project), the System.Linq.Async NuGet package is built as part of the Ix project.
